# WUDSN IDE Installer

Create a folder where you want to put the IDE.
Make sure the folder path contains no spaces or whitespaces.

On Windows, download wudsn.exe the folder run it.

Versions for macOS and Linux are in the making.

The file will create and populate the following subfolders via downloads:
- Install - the cache folder where all downloads are stored
- Tools - the IDE and all related command line programs
- Projects - the platform specific project folders with sample source code
- Workspace - the workspace where the IDE stores data that is no source code

Upon the first start you'll be prompted with the Eclipse Welcome screen.
In addition you can choose for which platform you want to import the same projects.
The path to the assemblers/compilers/emulators in the Tools folder must be set once manually.
I plan to improve this in future releases of the IDE.

In case of problems check the wudsn.log file in the folder.
You can also run wudsn.exe from the command line with the parameter --install.
This will display the installer menu with options to reinstall or update the IDE.
